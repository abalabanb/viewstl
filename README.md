# viewstl
Some ancient as fuck stl viewing program I found on SpywareForge.
This is mostly just to get the GNU/Linux version into a better state. There are better STL viewers out there that use more modern OpenGL versions but are bloated. Use those instead.

If for whatever silly reason you're on Windows or IRIX in $CURRENT_YEAR you can find the code and build files for those versions in [viewstl_original.tar.gz](viewstl_original.tar.gz).
